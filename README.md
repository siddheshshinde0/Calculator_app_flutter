# Flutter Demo Application

This repository contains a simple Flutter application demonstrating the basic structure and functionality of a Flutter project. It includes examples of state management, widgets, theming, and the use of hot reload for efficient development.

## Features

- **Counter App:** A basic app that increments a counter when a button is pressed.
- **Material Design:** Utilizes Material Design components for a modern and clean UI.
- **State Management:** Demonstrates the use of `setState` for managing state in Flutter.
- **Hot Reload Support:** Optimized for testing changes with Flutter's hot reload feature.

## Project Structure

### `main.dart`
The entry point of the application.

- **`MyApp` Widget:** The root widget of the application. It sets up the `MaterialApp` with a theme and a home page.
- **`MyHomePage` Widget:** A stateful widget that serves as the main screen of the app. It displays a counter and a button to increment it.

### Key Components

1. **AppBar:** The top navigation bar that displays the app's title.
2. **FloatingActionButton:** A floating button that allows the user to increment the counter.
3. **Text Widgets:** Used to display static and dynamic text, including the counter value.
4. **Column and Center Widgets:** Layout widgets that structure the UI elements vertically and center them on the screen.

## How to Run the App

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd <repository_name>
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   Make sure you have Flutter installed. Run the following command to fetch dependencies:
   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

3. **Run the App:**
   Use the following command to start the app:
   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```
   Ensure you have an emulator or physical device connected.

## How It Works

1. **State Management:**
   - The `_counter` variable in the `_MyHomePageState` class keeps track of the counter value.
   - The `setState` method is called to update the UI whenever the counter is incremented.

2. **Theming:**
   - The `ThemeData` in `MaterialApp` defines the app's color scheme using `ColorScheme.fromSeed`.
   - The `AppBar` and other UI elements adapt to the theme for a consistent look and feel.

## Customization

- Change the theme's primary color by modifying the `seedColor` in the `ThemeData`.
- Update the `Text` widgets to display custom messages or styles.
- Add additional buttons or functionalities to extend the app.

## Requirements

- Flutter SDK
- Dart SDK
